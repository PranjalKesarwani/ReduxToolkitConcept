If you want to use redux toolkit in your project follow these basic steps

1- Make directory store inside src, now this directory will contain all the folders of redux code
2- Inside store folder make folders actions and slices and one file index.js for central store which will contain the state of all the reducers present in slices
3- In index.js i.e. where the central store is made, export this to your main.jsx and now connect it with your react project by using <Provider></Provider> and passing the store as prop so now it will be accessible to all the components
4- Now lets talk about slices->  Now like pizza have multiple slices, here so, we use multiple slices for different purposes, like with reference to e-commerce application, a user have cart, orders, so there states will be different so we will make two slices orderSlice and cartSlice, now both will have their own state, if you add to cart then cart's state will change and if you ordered then order's state will change, so we made two slices. 
             Inside userSlice of this thapa project, reducers contains multiple action creator functions. We did export default userSlice.reducer, one thing notice that here write reducer not reducers, okay, this will be imported on store so that the all the states of the reducer get stored in the store.
5- Now it's time to use action creator function, suppose you did onClick now you will run a function which will contain an action creator function taking the required payload and also this action creator function will be imported too from the slices.
6- There is a concept of extraReducers whose work is to provide that action creator function which will be used by various slices, suppose in case of e-commerce application, if i want to clear the order and all the cart items then for both situation i can call that extra reducer instead of going in any slice, so this will will be independent of the slices and it will not be needed to export it, we will directly import this extraReducers function in the required components. 
            To make the extra reducer, you need to make a folder actions in store folder and make index.js inside actions, now use createAction() to create the action and name the action you want and use it same in the extraReducers
